An example of this<br>may be seen at the poisoning, adverse effect, underdosing (T36-T50), and toxic effects (T51-T65) codes. For these<br>categories, the sixth character represents the intent: accidental, intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined, adverse effect,<br>or underdosing. Where a placeholder exists, the “x” must be used for the code to be considered valid.<br><br>For example, “x” is used as the fifth character in the following codes where the sixth character of “1” represents accidental,<br>and “2” represents intentional self-harm:<br><br>T37.5x1 Poisoning by antiviral drugs, accidental (unintentional)<br>T37.5x2 Poisoning by antiviral drugs, intentional self-harm<br><br>T52.0x1 Toxic effect of petroleum products, accidental (unintentional)<br>T52.0x2 Toxic effect of petroleum products, intentional self-harm<br><br>Codes in certain categories include a seventh-character value. The applicable seventh-character value is required for all<br>codes within the category, or as the notes in the Tabular List instruct. The seventh-character value must always be the<br>seventh character in the code. If a code is not a full six characters and a seventh-character value is required, a placeholder<br>character “x” must be used to fill in the empty characters. Codes with seventh-character values are found in chapter 15 of<br>ICD-10-CM, Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Puerperium (O00—O9,A), as well as in chapter 19 of ICD-10-CM, Injury,<br>Poisoning and Certain Other Consequences of External Causes (SO00-T88), and in chapter 20 of ICD-10-CM, External<br>Causes of Morbidity (V00O-V99).<br><br>An example of the use of the placeholder character “x” and the seventh-character value is shown here with an excerpt from<br>the Tabular List:<br><br>Foreign body in ear<br>Includes: foreign body in auditory canal<br><br>The appropriate 7th character values are to be added to each code from category T16:<br><br>Tig A initial encounter<br>D subsequent encounter<br>S sequela<br>T16.1 Foreign body in right ear<br>T16.2 Foreign body in left ear<br>T16.9 Foreign body in ear, unspecified ear<br><br>A child presents to the emergency department with a bean in the right ear. The mother has brought the child because she was<br>not able to remove the bean at home. This encounter would be assigned code T16.1xxA. The Tabular List shows<br>subcategory T16.1 as the descriptor best fitting this scenario. Category T16 requires a seventh-character value. Because the<br>code subcategory has only four characters (T16,1), the placeholder “x” is inserted twice to preserve the code structure before<br>the seventh character “A” is added to report this as the initial encounter.<br><br>ALPHABETIC INDEX<br><br>The Alphabetic Index consists of the Index of Diseases and Injuries, the Index to External Causes, the Neoplasm Table, and<br>the Table of Drugs and Chemicals.<br><br>The Alphabetic Index includes entries for main terms, subterms, and more specific subterms. An indented format is used for<br>ease of reference.<br><br>Main terms identify disease conditions or injuries. Subterms indicate site, type, or etiology for conditions or injuries.

Occasionally, it is necessary to think of a synonym or another alternative term in order to locate the correct entry.<br>There are, however, exceptions to this general rule, including the following:<br><br>« Congenital conditions are often indexed under the main term Anomaly rather than under the name of the condition.<br><br>« Conditions that complicate pregnancy, childbirth, or the puerperium are usually found under such terms as Delivery,<br>Pregnancy, and Puerperal. They may also appear under the main term for the condition causing the complication<br>by referencing the subterm “complicating childbirth (labor),” “complicating pregnancy,” or “complicating<br>puerperium.” (Examples of these types of entries appear under the main term Hypertension in the Alphabetic Index.)<br><br>« Many of the complications of medical or surgical care are indexed under the term Complications rather than under<br>the name of the condition.<br><br>« Late effects of an earlier condition can be found under Sequelae, or under the condition (as in the case of traumatic<br>injuries).<br><br>A clear understanding of the format of the Alphabetic Index is a prerequisite for accurate coding. Understanding the<br>indention pattern of the entries is a very important part of learning how to use the Index. A variety of vendors provide<br>printed versions and others have computer programs for coding, but the format may not be consistent across versions. The<br>PDF version of the Index from the NCHS represents each indention level by a hyphen. In general, however, the following<br>pattern is used by several codebook publishers:<br><br>* Main terms are set flush with the left-hand margin. They are printed in bold type and begin with a capital letter.<br><br>« Subterms are indented one standard indention (equivalent toabout two word-processing spaces) to the right under the<br>main term. They are printed in regular type and begin with a lowercase letter.<br><br>« More specific subterms are indented farther and farther. to the right as needed, always indented by one standard<br>indention from the preceding subterm and listed in alphabetical order.<br><br>« A dash (-) at the end of an index entry indicates that additional characters are required.<br><br>Carryover lines are indented two standard indentions from the level of the preceding line. Carryover lines are used only<br>when the complete entry cannot fit on a single line. They are indented farther to avotd confusion with subterm entries.<br><br>In printed versions, entries are presented in two, three, or four columns per page, dictionary style.<br><br>The subterms listed under the main term Metrorrhagia in the following entry provide an example:<br><br>Metrorrhagia N92.1 [main term]<br><br>climacteric N92.4 [subterm]<br><br>menopausal N92.4 [subterm]<br>perimenopausal N92.4 [subterm]<br><br>postpartum NEC (atonic) (following delivery of placenta) 072.1 ieatyover line]<br>delayed or secondary 072.2 [more specific subterm]<br>preclimacteric or premenopausal N92.4 [subterm]<br><br>psychogenic F45.8 [subterm]<br><br>Each of the subterms (climacteric, menopausal, perimenopausal, postpartum, preclimacteric or premenopausal, and<br>psychogenic) is indented one standard indention from the level of the main term and is listed in alphabetical order. The sixth<br>line is a carryover line set two standard indentions from the preceding line.

However, if a<br>patient has both attention-deficit hyperactivity and an anxiety disorder, a code from category F90 could be used along with a<br>code from category F40 or F41.<br><br>“Code First” and “Use Additional Code”<br><br>Certain conditions have both an underlying etiology and multiple body system manifestations due to the underlying etiology.<br>In the Tabular List, “code first” and “use additional code” instructional notes indicate the proper sequencing order of these<br>conditions—etiology (underlying condition) followed by manifestation. The “use additional code” note is found at the<br>etiology code as a clue to identify the manifestations commonly associated with the disease. The “code first” note is found at<br>the manifestation code to provide instructions that the underlying condition, if present, should be sequenced first.<br><br>The manifestation codes usually have the phrase “in diseases classified elsewhere” as part of the code title. Codes with this<br>phrase are never used as a first-listed or principal diagnosis code. For such codes, a “use additional code” note appears at the<br>etiology code, and a “code first” note appears at the manifestation code. An example of this convention is category F02,<br>Dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere.<br><br>Other notes of this type provide a list introduced by the phrase “such as,” meaning that any of the listed codes or any other<br>appropriate code can be assigned first. Code 199, Respiratory disorders in diseases classified elsewhere,<br>provides a list of conditions that may be the underlying disease.<br><br>It is not necessary to report the code identified in. a,“use additional code” note in the diagnosis field immediately following<br>the primary code. There is no strict hierarchy inherent in the guidelines, nor in the [CD-10-CM classification, regarding the<br>sequencing of secondary diagnosis codes.<br><br>“Code Also”<br><br>“Code also” notes in ICD-10-CM indicate that two codes may be required to fully describe a condition. This note does not<br>provide sequencing direction. The sequencing order will depend on the circumstances of admission (i.e., reason for the<br>encounter). An example of this note can be found under code G47.61, Insomnia due to medical condition, where the<br>instructional note tells the coding professional to code also the associated medical condition.<br><br>ABBREVIATIONS<br><br>ICD-10-CM uses two main abbreviations:<br>*« NEC, for “not elsewhere classified”<br>« NOS, for “not otherwise specified”<br><br>Although their meanings appear simple, these abbreviations are often misunderstood and misapplied.

For<br>example, a cross-reference under the Index entry for main term Mononeuropathy, subterm “in diseases classified<br>elsewhere,” refers the user to category G59,<br><br>“See Condition”<br><br>Occasionally, the Index advises the user to refer to the main term of a condition. For example, when a user looks up the main<br>term Arterial to find the code for arterial thrombosis, the Index advice is to “see condition.” Therefore, the user should<br>then go to the main term Thrombosis. This cross-reference ordinarily appears when the adjective rather than the term (in<br>noun form) has been referenced for the condition itself.<br><br>PUNCTUATION MARKS<br><br>Several of the punctuation marks used in ICD-10-CM have a specialized meaning in addition to the usual English language<br>usage.<br><br>Parentheses<br><br>Parentheses are used in ICD-10-CM to enclose supplementary words or explanatory information that may be either present<br>or absent in the statement of diagnosis without affecting the code to which it is assigned, Such terms are considered to be<br>“nonessential modifiers” and are used to suggest that the terms in parentheses are included in the code but need not be stated<br>in the diagnosis. This is a significant factor in correct code assignment. Terms enclosed in parentheses in either the Tabular<br>List or the Alphabetic Index do not affect the code assignment in any way; they serve only as reassurance that the correct<br>code has been located.<br><br>For example, refer to the main term Pneumonia, which has several nonessential modifiers enclosed in parentheses. Unless a<br>more specific subterm is located, this code will be assigned for pneumonia described by any of the terms in parentheses.<br>Diagnoses of acute pneumonia.and purulent pneumonia, for example, are both coded J18.9 because both terms appear in<br>parentheses as nonessential modifiers. Pneumonia not otherwise specified is also assigned to code J18.9 because none of the<br>terms in parentheses is required for this code assignment.<br><br>It is important to distinguish between the uses of nonessential and essential modifiers. Essential modifiers are listed as<br>subterms in the Alphabetic Index, not in parentheses, and they do affect code assignment. In contrast, words in parentheses<br>are nonessential and do not affect the code assignment. For example, scoliosis described as acquired or postural is classified<br>as M41.9, as the words “acquired” and “postural”yare nonessential modifiers and do not affect the code; on the other hand,<br>the term “congenital” is an essential modifier, and the code for this type of scoliosis is Q67.5.<br><br>The nonessential modifiers in the Index to Diseases apply to subterms following a main term, except when a nonessential<br>modifier and a subentry are mutually exclusive, in which case the subentry takes precedence. For example, in ICD-10-CM’s<br>Alphabetic Index under the main term Enteritis, “acute” is a nonessential modifier, and “chronic” is a subentry. In this<br>case, the nonessential modifier “acute” does not apply to the subentry “chronic.”<br></p></div>

For<br>example, the comma may indicate alternate verbiage, a modifier (essential and nonessential), or an alternative to “and/or.”<br><br>Exercise 2.2<br><br>Referring only to the title and inclusion notes provided for the four-character code D04.5, mark an “X” next to each<br>diagnosis listed below that is included in code D04.5.<br><br>RELATIONAL TERMS<br><br>“And F<br><br>The word “and” should be interpreted to mean either “and” or “or” when it appears in a code title. For example, cases of<br>“tuberculosis of bones,” “tuberculosis of joints,” and “tuberculosis of bones and joints” are classified to subcategory A18.0,<br>Tuberculosis of bones and joints.<br><br>“With” and “In”<br><br>The words “with” and “in” should be interpreted to mean “associatedewith” or “due to” when they appear in a code title, the<br>Alphabetic Index (either under a main term or subterm), or an instructional note in the Tabular List. The classification<br>presumes a causal relationship between the two conditions linked by these terms in the Alphabetic Index or the Tabular List.<br>These conditions should be coded as related even in the absence of provider documentation explicitly linking them, unless<br>the documentation clearly states the conditions are unrelated, or unless another guideline exists that specifically requires a<br>documented linkage between two conditions (for example, a sepsis guideline for “acute organ dysfunction that is not clearly<br>associated with the sepsis”). If conditions are not specifically linked by these relational terms in the classification, or if a<br>guideline requires that a linkage between two conditions be explicitly documented, provider documentation must link the<br>conditions in order for them to be coded as related. The word “with” in the Alphabetic Index is sequenced immediately<br>following the main term or subterm and is not in alphabetical order.<br><br>The following example from the Alphabetic Index for the main term Diabetes and the subterm “with” demonstrates the<br>linkage between conditions:<br><br>Diabetes, diabetic (mellitus) (sugar) E11.9<br>-with<br><br>--amyotrophy E1144<br><br>--arthropathy NEC E11.618<br><br>--autonomic (poly) neuropathy E11.43<br>--cataract E11.36<br><br>--Charcot’s joints E11.610<br><br>--chronic kidney disease E11.22<br><br>The diagnoses of diabetes and chronic kidney disease are coded as £11.22, Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic<br>chronic kidney disease. This link can be assumed because chronic kidney disease is listed under the subterm “with.”<br><br>The following example from the Alphabetic Index for the main term Anemia and the subterm “in” demonstrates the linkage<br>between conditions:<br><br>Anemia (essential) (general) (hemoglobin deficiency) (infantile) (primary) (profound) D64.9 ...<br>-in (due to) (with)<br><br>--chronic kidney disease D63.1<br><br>--end stage renal disease D63.1<br><br>--failure, kidney (renal) D63.1<br><br>--neoplastic disease (see also Neoplasm) D63.0<br></p></div>

This<br>linkage can be assumed because the chronic kidney disease is listed under the subterm “in (due to) (with).”<br><br>“Due To”<br><br>The phrase “due to” in either the Alphabetic Index or the Tabular List indicates that a causal relationship between two<br>conditions is present. ICD-10-CM occasionally makes such an assumption when both conditions are present. For example,<br>certain conditions affecting the mitral valve are assumed to be rheumatic in origin, regardless of whether or not the<br>diagnostic statement specifies this causal relationship. However, for other combinations of conditions, a causal relationship<br>should not be presumed if it is not indicated in the diagnostic statement. When the physician's statement indicates a causal<br>relationship, the coding professional should locate the subterm “due to” under the relevant term in the Alphabetic Index to<br>select the appropriate code to look up in the Tabular List.<br></p></div>

Accurate and ethical reporting requifes'the correct selection of those conditions that meet the criteria<br>set by the UHDDS and the official guidelines mentioned above. Over-coding and over-reporting may result in higher<br>payment, but those practices are unethical and may be considered fraudulent. On the other hand, it is important to be sure<br>that all appropriate codes are reported, as failure to include all diagnoses or procedures that meet reporting criteria may<br>result in financial loss for the health care provider.<br><br>It is important to abide by the American Health Information Management Association Standards of Ethical Coding, which<br>are available at https://bok.ahima.org/topics/coding-compliance-and-revenue-eycle/american-health-information-<br>management-association-standards-of-ethical-coding-2016-version.<br><br>Occasionally, certain codes are identified by Medicare or another payer as being unacceptable as the principal diagnosis.<br>This does not mean that the code should not be assigned when it is.correct; it means that the third-party payer may question<br>or deny payment. Coding professionals must code correctly and then make whatever adjustment is required for reporting, or<br>they run the risk of developing incorrect coding practices that-will distort data used for other purposes.<br><br>Hospitals sometimes identify a need to code nonreportable diagnoses or procedures for internal use. This is acceptable if the<br>facility has a system for maintaining this information outside the reporting system.<br><br>There are a variety of payment policies that may have an impact on coding. Those policies may contradict each other or may<br>be inconsistent with ICD-10-CM/PCS rules and conventions. Therefore, it is not possible to write coding guidelines that are<br>consistent with all existing payer guidelines.<br><br>The following advice is shared to help providers resolve coding disputes with payers:<br><br>« First, determine whether the problem is really a coding dispute and not a coverage issue. Always contact the payer for<br>clarification if the reason for the denial is unclear.<br></p></div>

Violators will be prosecuted.<br><br>CODING DEMONSTRATIONS<br><br>Follow the steps outlined above to determine the correct code for each of the diagnostic statements listed below:<br><br>* Hirsutism<br>Refer to the main term Hirsutism in the Alphabetic Index, which provides a code of L68.0. Note that there are no<br>subterms. Verify this by referring to code L68.0 in the Tabular List. In this case, the Index entry and Tabular List title<br>are identical and code L68.0 should be assigned.<br><br>* Portal vein obstruction<br>Refer to the main term Obstruction in the Alphabetic Index and the subterm for portal (circulation) (vein), which<br>provides a code of 181. In the Tabular List, the title for code 181 is “Portal (vein) thrombosis” but an inclusion term is<br>“portal (vein) obstruction.” If you are uncertain whether thrombosis and obstruction are the same condition for the<br>purposes of coding, check the Index for the main term Thrombosis.<br><br>* Abscess abdominal wall due to Staphylococcus<br>Look up the main term Abscess in the Alphabetic Index and then the subterm “abdomen, abdominal”; and then the<br>subterm “wall.” The code entry is LO02.211. Read the “use ‘additional code’ note” in the Tabular List that advises you<br>to also assign a code to identify the organism involved (B95—B96). Hint: if you have trouble locating this note, check<br>under the category title LO2. Look up Infection, staphylococcal, and the subterm “as cause of disease classified<br>elsewhere” in the Alphabetic Index and find code B95.8. In the Tabular List, the code title for B95.8 is “Unspecified<br>staphylococcus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere.” Review the medical record for any mention of the<br>specific type of Staphylococcus. If one is mentioned, consider assigning the code B95.61, B95.62, or B95.7; if not,<br>assign code B95.8 as an additional code.<br><br>* Aplasia of pulmonary artery<br>Refer to the main term Aplasia in the Alphabetic Index. Check the subterms, and note that there is no entry for<br>pulmonary artery. However, there is a cross-reference note after ApLasia to “see also Agenesis.” Follow the cross-<br>reference advice and refer to the main term Agenesis. You immediately see a mone Specific subterm for “artery,<br>pulmonary,” with code entry 025.79. The title for this code in the Tabular List is “Other congenital malformations of<br>pulmonary artery,” and it is clearly the correct code for this condition. As additional confirmation that this is the<br>correct code, “agenesis of pulmonary artery” is listed as an inclusion term.<br><br>* Acute bronchopneumonia due to aspiration of oil<br>Locate the main term Bronchopneumonia in the Alphabetic Index. Note the cross-reference instruction to “see<br>Pneumonia, broncho.” Follow the cross-reference by turning to the main term Pneumonia (acute) (double)<br>(migratory).... Note that the term “acute” is a nonessential,modifier enclosed in parentheses following the main term<br>Pneumonia. This nonessential modifier applies also to the subterms, and so the term “acute” has now been accounted<br>for but does not directly affect code assignment. Refer to the following subterms listed under the main term:<br><br>Pneumonia (acute) (double) (migratory) ...<br><br>-broncho-, bronchial (confluent) (croupous)<br>(diffuse) (disseminated) (hemorrhagic) ...<br><br>--aspiration—see Pneumonia, aspiration<br><br>Note the cross-reference to “see Pneumonia, aspiration.” Refer back to the subterm “aspiration” and locate the code J69.0.<br>Search through the main term and subterms cited above and underline the component parts of the diagnostic statement that<br>have been located so far. Note that all component parts of the diagnostic statement except “of oil” have been located. Refer<br>back to “Pneumonia, aspiration,” and you will see that there are additional subterms here under the connecting words “due<br>to,” with a subterm for “oils, essences” that takes you to code J69.1. Refer to code J69.1 in the Tabular List, and note that the<br>title for this code is “Pneumonitis due to inhalation of oils and essences.” Although the title is not worded exactly the same<br>as the diagnosis, there is such a close correlation that it is clear that this is the code that should be assigned. Assign code<br>J69.1 because it covers all elements of the diagnosis and no instructional notes contradict its use.<br><br>Review Exercise 5.2<br><br>[sina the Alnhahetic Index and the Tahular List code the followine diagnoses<br></p></div>

This code<br>should never be assigned without a careful review of subterms to determine whether a more specific code can be located.<br>When the review does not identify a more specific code entry in the Index, the titles and inclusion notes in the subdivisions<br>under the three-character, four-character, or five-character code in the Tabular List should be reviewed. The residual NOS<br>(not otherwise specified) code should never be assigned when a more specific code is available. The following examples<br>demonstrate this basic coding principle:<br><br>Refer to the Alphabetic Index for nontraumatic hematoma of breast, which is classified as N64.89. In the Tabular List,<br>this code is listed as “other” specified disorders of the breast. Even though the diagnosis is very specific, no separate<br>code is provided for it.<br><br>Refer to the Alphabetic Index for phlebitis. Note that phlebitis, not otherwise specified, is assigned to code 180.9,<br>Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of unspecified site. Now, suppose that review of the medical record<br>provides even further specificity, that the diagnosis is phlebitis of not only the lower extremity but the right popliteal<br>vein. The more specific code 180.221, Phlebitis and thrombophlebitis of right popliteal vein, should be<br>assigned.<br></p></div>
